# Module quiz: Basic Programming with Python

1. Which of the following is not a sequence data-type in Python?
   - List
   - String
   - Dictionary
   - Tuples
   ```
   Answer: Dictionary
   Explanation: Dictionaries have key-value object structure and are not sequences.
   ```

2. For a given list called `new_list`, which of the following options will work:
    ```python
    new_list = [1,2,3,4]
    ```
   Select all that apply.
   -    ```python
        new_list[4] = 10
        ```
   -    ```python
        new_list.extend(new_list)
        ```
   -    ```python
        new_list.insert(0, 0)
        ```
   -    ```python
        new_list.append(5)
        ```
   ```
   Answer: new_list.extend(new_list)
           new_list.insert(0, 0)
           new_list.append(5)
   Explanation: new_list.extend(new_list) will extend the list to give [1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4]
                new_list.insert(0, 0) will insert 0 at the 0th index giving: [0,1,2,3,4]
                new_list.append(5) will append the value 5 to the list giving: [1,2,3,4,5]
   ```

3. Which of the following is not a type of variable scope in Python?
   - Local
   - Global
   - Enclosing
   - Package
   ```
   Answer: Package
   Explanation: Packages do not define a scope, they are external installations that we bring to extend code functionality.
   ```

4. Which of the following is a built-in data structure in Python?
   - Set
   - Queue
   - LinkedList
   - Tree
   ```
   Answer: Set
   Explanation: Set is a built-in data structure such as list, tuple, etc.
   ```

5. For a given file called `names.txt`, which of the following is NOT a valid syntax for opening a file:
   -    ```python
        with open('names.txt', 'r') as file:
            print(type(file))
        ```

   -    ```python
        with open('names.txt', 'w') as file:
            print(type(file))
        ```

   -    ```python
        with open('names.txt', 'rb') as file:
            print(type(file))
        ```

   -    ```python
        with open('names.txt', 'rw') as file:
            print(type(file))
        ```
   ```
   Answer: 
    with open('names.txt', 'rw') as file:
        print(type(file))
   Explanation: It should either be ‘r’ mode for reading or ‘w’ mode for writing. 
   ```

6. Which among the following is not a valid Exception in Python?
   - ZeroDivisionException
   - FileNotFoundError
   - IndexError
   - LoopError
   ```
   Answer: LoopError
   Explanation: There is no such Exception defined in Python.
   ```

7. For a file called `name.txt` containing the lines below:
   ```
   First line
   Second line
   And another !
   ```
   What will be the output of the following code:
   ```python
    with open('names.txt', 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
        print(lines)
   ```
   -    ```
        'First line'
        ```

   -    ```
        ['First line\n',
         'Second line\n',
         'And another !']
        ```

   -    ```
        ['First line']
        ```

   -    ```
        'First line'
        'Second line'
        'And another !'
        ```
   ```
   Answer: ['First line\n',
            'Second line\n',
            'And another !']
   Explanation: readlines() returns an ordered list with lines in the text file as items in the list.
   ```

8. State TRUE or FALSE: `*args` passed to the functions can accept the key-value pair. 
   - True
   - False
   ```
   Answer: False
   Explanation: You use **kwargs for passing dictionaries or videos containing key-value pairs.
   ```
