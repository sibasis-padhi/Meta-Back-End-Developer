# Exercise: Use control flow and loops to solve a problem

## Introduction
In this exercise, you will practice control flow with loops to solve problems. You will be given a list of integers and you will have to add some code to find a specific number in a list and return it. 

## Instructions
1. Under the num_list create a new for loop and print out each value on the list in sequential order.

2. Inside the for loop, create a condition that will look for all numbers that are greater than 45 and print out only numbers that meet that condition

3. Change the print statement to “Over 45” and add an else condition with a print statement of “Under 45”.

4. Update the for loop to use the enumerate function so you can get and use the index. Alter the condition to look for number 36 and print out the following: ‘Number found at position: ‘, index number

5. Next, create a new variable called count and assign it a value of 0 and place it outside the for loop.

6. Inside the for loop increment the counter by 1.

7. Add a print statement outside the for loop to print the value of the count variable.

8. Finally, add a break statement directly after the print statement inside the if condition for finding the number.

## Self-review
1. Python `for` loops work on any type of sequence data type including strings.
   - True
   - False
   ```
   Answer: True
   Explanation: Python for loops work on any type of sequence data type including strings.
   ```

2. The `enumerate` function is used to provide the index of current iteration of a for loop.
   - True
   - False
   ```
   Answer: True
   Explanation: An enumerate function is used to provide the index of current iteration of a for loop.
   ```

3. A `break` statement can be used to exit out of a for loop based on a certain condition being satisified.
   - True
   - False
   ```
   Answer: True
   Explanation: A break statement is used to exit out of a for loop based on a certain condition being satisified.
