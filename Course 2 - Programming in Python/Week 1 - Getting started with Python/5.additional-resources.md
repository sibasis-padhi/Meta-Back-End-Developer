## Welcome to Python Programming

Python allows you to do quite a lot with very little code. Compared to other languages such as Java or C#, Python has a much easier learning curve. It lends itself well to the "write less, do more philosophy". Python developers are also in high demand and learning how to program in Python makes for a good career choice.
