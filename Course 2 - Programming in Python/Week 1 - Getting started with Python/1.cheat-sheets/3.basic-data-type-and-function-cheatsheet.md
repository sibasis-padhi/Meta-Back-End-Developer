# Basic Data type and Function Cheatsheet

## Data types

| Data type | Meaning | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| string | Text | `'Hello'`, `'Testing 123'` |
| integer | Numbers | `-5`, `4`, `3`, `2`, `0` |
| float | Decimals | `2.4`, `5.2`, `1000.00` |

## Flow Control

__Comparison operators__

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `==` | Equals | `a == b` |
| `!=` | Not Equal | `a != b` |
| `<` | Less than | `a < b` |
| `>` | Greater than | `a > b` |
| `<=` | Less than or Equal to | `a <= b` |
| `>=` | Greater than or Equal to | `a >= b` |

## Comments

__Single-line comments__

Placing a `#` symbol in front of the text you want to be a comment causes Python to ignore everything from that point until the end of the current line.

```python
# Single Line comment
```

__Multi-line comments__

Python does not really have a method for multi line comments, so a `#` symbol can be used on every line.

```python
# This is a multiline comment
# which can be used for long comments
```

__Inline/code comments__

The `#` symbol will cause Python to ignore everything from that point until the end of the current line, so inline comments can be created in this way.

```python
x = 1 # assigns value of 1 to x
```

## Built-in Functions

__`print()`__

This function looks for the default output device, your terminal, and displays the value passed to it.

```python
print("Hello")
```

__`input()`__

This function looks for the default input device, your keyboard, and captures the value. This value can then be assigned or used.

```python
print("Where do you live?")
location = input()
print("So you live in " + location)
```

__`len()`__

This function returns the length or the count of the elements contained within the structure it is applied on. This may be a string, array, list, tuple, dictionary or any sequence.

```python
len("Hello")
```

__`str()`__

This function can be used to convert the provided value into a `String`

```python
str(55)
```

__`int()`__

This function can be used to convert the provided value into an `int`

```python
int('75')
```

__`float()`__

This function can be used to convert the provided value into a `float`

```python
some_int = 10
float(some_int)
```

## Creating Functions

Functions in Python require a keyword to define them : `def` followed by an identifier (a name) this forms the function signature. The body of the function contains the code to run when the function is called.

```python

def say_hello():
    return "Hello there!"

# With parameters
def say_hello(you):
    return "Hello " +  you
```
