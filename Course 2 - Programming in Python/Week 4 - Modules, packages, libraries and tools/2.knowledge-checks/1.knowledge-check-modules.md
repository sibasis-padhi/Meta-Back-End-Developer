# Knowledge check: Modules

1. Assuming there exists a module called ‘numpy’ with a function called ‘shape’ inside it, which of the following is NOT a valid syntax for writing an import statement? (Select all that apply)
   - import numpy as dn
   - import * from numpy
   - from numpy import shape as s
   - import shape from numpy
   - from numpy import *
   ```
   Answer: import * from numpy
           import shape from numpy
   Explanation: import * from numpy is an incorrect format
                import shape from numpy is an incorrect format
   ```

2. Which of the following locations does the Python interpreter search for modules by default?
   - PYTHONPATH or simply the environment variable that contains list of directories
   - The current working directory
   - Any user-specified location added to the System path using sys package
   - Installation-dependent default directory
   ```
   Answer: Any user-specified location added to the System path using sys package
   Explanation: The location is accessible, but not by default.
   ```

3. We can import a text file using the import statement in Python
   - True
   - False
   ```
   Answer: False
   Explanation: Import statement can only be used for importing Python filetypes and packages.
   ```

4. Which of the following statements is NOT true about the `reload()` function?
   - You need to import a module before the `reload()` function can be used over it.
   - The `reload()` function can be used for making dynamic changes within code.
   - You can use the `reload()` function multiple times for the same module in the given code.
   - The `reload()` function can be used to import modules in Python.
   ```
   Answer: The reload() function can be used to import modules in Python.
   Explanation: The module has to be imported separately. The reload() function cannot import module.
   ```

5. Which of the following is NOT to be considered as an advantage of modular programming while using Python?
   - Reusability
   - Security
   - Scope
   - Simplicity
   ```
   Answer: Security
   Explanation: While some modules may supply security features, modular programming is not designed by default for security.
   ```

6. Which of the following module types are directly available for import without any additional installation when you begin writing our code in Python? (Select all that apply)
   - User-defined modules in Home directory of the device
   - Modules in the current working directory of the Project
   - Third-party packages from Python Package Index not present on the device
   - Built-in modules
   ```
   Answer: Modules in the current working directory of the Project
           Built-in modules
   Explanation: Modules in the current working directory of the project are directly available for import without any additional installation when you begin writing our code in Python.
                Built-in modules are directly available for import without any additional installation when you begin writing our code in Python.
