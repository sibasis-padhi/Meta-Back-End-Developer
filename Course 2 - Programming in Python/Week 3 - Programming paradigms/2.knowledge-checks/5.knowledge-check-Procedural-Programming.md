# Knowledge check: Abstract classes and methods

1. Which of the algorithm types below finds the best solution in each and every step instead of being overall optimal?

   - Dynamic Programming
   - Divide and conquer
   - Greedy.
   - Recursive

   ```
   Answer: Greedy
   Explanation: Greedy algorithms optimise at every step.
   ```

2. Which of the following Big O notations for function types has the slowest time complexity?

   - O(log(n)).
   - O(c)
   - O(n!).
   - O(n^3).

   ```
   Answer: O(n!)
   Explanation: O(n!) has the slowest time complexity.
   ```

3. True or False: Linear time algorithms will always run under the same time and space regardless of the size of input.

   - True
   - False.

   ```
   Answer: False
   Explanation: This is the definition of Constant time complexity. Linear time is dependent on the size of the input.
   ```

4. For determining efficiency, which of the following factors must be considered important?
   - Time Complexity
   - Space Complexity
   - Neither of the two options above
   - Both A and B
   ```
   Answer: Both A and B
   Explanation:  Both time and space complexity are important
   ```
