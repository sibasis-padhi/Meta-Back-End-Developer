# Knowledge check: Functional Programming

1. What will be the output of the recursive code below?
   ```python
    def sum(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        return n + sum(n-1)
    
    a = sum(5)
    print(a)
   ```
   - 15
   - 0
   - 14
   - RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
   ```
   Answer: 14
   Explanation: The output will be the sum of values from 2 to 5.
   ```

2. Statement A: A function in Python only executes when called.
   Statement B: Functions in Python always returns a value.
   - Both A and B are True
   - B is True but A is False
   - A is True but B is False
   - Both A and B are False
   ```
   Answer: A is True but B is False
   Explanation: Functions need to be called and don't always have to return a value.
   ```

3. Which of the below are valid functions in Python? (Select all that apply)
   ```python
    some = ["aaa", "bbb"]
    
    #1
    def aa(some):
        return
    
    #2
    def aa(some, 5):
        return

    #3
    def aa():
        return

    #4
    def aa():
        return "aaa"
   ```
   - 1
   - 4
   - 3
   - 2
   ```
   Answer: 1, 3, 4
   Explanation: Function 1 can return even if the argument passed is unused
                The empty function 3 can exist even if it has no functionality
                You can return a string such as “aaa” from function 4
   ```

4. For the following code:
   ```python
    numbers = [15, 30, 47, 82, 95]
    def lesser(numbers):
        return numbers < 50

    small = list(filter(lesser, numbers))
    print(small)
   ```
   If you modify the code above and change `filter()` function to `map()` function, what will be the list elements in the output that were not there earlier?
   - 15, 30, 47
   - 82, 95
   - 15, 30, 47, 82, 95
   - None of the other options
   ```
   Answer: None of the other options
   Explanation: The values returned by the map() function in this case are boolean values from the comparison done in the lesser() function. So the right answer is: True, False.
