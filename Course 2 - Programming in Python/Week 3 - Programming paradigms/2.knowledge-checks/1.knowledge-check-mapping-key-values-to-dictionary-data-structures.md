# Knowledge Check: Mapping key values to dictionary data structures

1. What will be the output of the following code
   ```python
    a = [[96], [69]]
    print(''.join(list(map(str, a))))
   ```
   -    ```python
        "[96][69]"
        ```
   -    ```python
        "[96],[69]"
        ```
   -    ```python
        [96][69]
        ```
   -    ```python
        "9669"
        ```
   ```
   Answer: "[96][69]"
   Explanation: It will initially be a list of strings such as ['[96]', '[69]'] which is then converted into a conjoined string.

2. Which of the following is TRUE about the `map()` and `filter()` functions?
   - Both the `map()` and `filter()` functions need to be defined before we use them. 
   - The `map()` function needs to be defined first, but the `filter()` function is built-in.
   - Both the `map()` and `filter()` functions are built-in. 
   - The `map()` function is built-in, but the `filter()` function needs to be defined first.
   ```
   Answer: Both the map() and filter() functions are built-in. 
   Explanation: Function you pass to filter() and map() function may need definition, but they both are built-in.
   ```

3. What will be the output of the following code:
   ```python
    z = ["alpha","bravo","charlie"]
    new_z = [i[0]*2for i in z]
    print(new_z)
   ```
   -    ```python
        [‘aa’], [‘bb’], [‘cc’]
        ```
   -    ```python
        ['aa', 'bb', 'cc']
        ```
   -    ```python
        [‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’]
        ```
   -    ```python
        ['alphaalpha', 'bravobravo', 'charliecharlie']
        ```
   ```
   Answer: ['aa', 'bb', 'cc']
   Explanation: The output will be a list of strings.
