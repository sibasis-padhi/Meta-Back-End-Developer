    - Atomicity problem.
    - Duplication of data.
    ```
    Answer: Duplication of data.
    Explanation: There is too much redundancy of data in the given table.
    ```

6. To normalize the following table of data, you must decompose it into how many tables?

    | Department ID | Department Name | Director | Course ID | Course Name | Tutor ID | Tutor |
    |---------------|-----------------|----------|-----------|-------------|----------|-------|
    | D1            | Computing       | Dr Karl  | C1        | Database    | T1       | Mark  |
    | D1            | Computing       | Dr Karl  | C2        | Python      | T1       | Mark  |
    | D1            | Computing       | Dr Karl  | C3        | Web         | T2       | Jack  |
    | D1            | Computing       | Dr Karl  | C4        | Java        | T2       | Jack  |
    | D2            | Math            | Dr Mosa  | C5        | Math        | T3       | Rose  |

    - Three tables (departments, courses, and tutors). 
    - Four tables (departments, directors, courses, and tutors).
    - Two tables (departments and courses).
    ```
    Answer: Three tables (departments, courses, and tutors).
    Explanation: There is too much redundancy of data in the given table.
    ```

7. The table below contains a composite primary key made up of the columns "Tutor ID" and "Subject". What kind of normalization problem does this composite key create?
    
    | <ins>Tutor ID</ins> | <ins>Subject</ins> | Credits |
    |---------------------|--------------------|---------|
    | T1                  | Java               | 20      |
    | T1                  | Web                | 15      |
    | T2                  | Math               | 15      |
    | T2                  | History            | 20      |

    - First normal form data redundancy
    - Second normal form partial dependency
    ```
    Answer: Second normal form partial dependency
    Explanation: The credits value is dependent on the subject value which is a subset of the composite primary key. This is called partial dependency that violates the second normal form.
    ```

8. Which of the following statements is the correct syntax to define a foreign key that links the "Players" and "Games" table in an ER diagram?

    <img src="./module-quiz-img.png" width=500>

    -   ```sql
        CREATE TABLE Games( gameID int NOT NULL, playerID int, PRIMARY KEY (gameID), FOREIGN KEY (playerID) REFERENCES players(playerID));
        ```
    -   ```sql
        CREATE TABLE Games( gameID int NOT NULL, playerID int, PRIMARY KEY (gameID), FOREIGN KEY (gameID) REFERENCES players(gameID));
        ```
    ```
    Answer: CREATE TABLE Games( gameID int NOT NULL, playerID int, PRIMARY KEY (gameID), FOREIGN KEY (playerID) REFERENCES players(playerID));
    Explanation: In this example the SQL statement creates a FOREIGN KEY on the "playerID" column when the "Games" table is created.
    ```

9. A database relation is in second normal form if it is in first normal form and every non key attribute is __________ functionally dependent on the primary key.
    - Fully
    - Partially
    ```
    Answer: Fully
    Explanation: A database relation is in second normal form if it is in first normal form and every non key attribute is fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
    ```

10. Database normalization is a progressive process, which means that the database relation cannot be in the third normal form if it is not already applying the rules of the first and the second normal forms.
    - True
    - False
    ```
    Answer: True
    Explanation: Database normalization is a progressive process.
    ```
