    - Email
    - Student name
    - Date of Birth
    ```
    Answer: Email
    Explanation: This column is the right choice because it contains unique values in each row of the table.
    ```

2. What type of primary key is used in the following `Sales` table?
    | Customer ID | Order ID | Product Code | Quantity |
    |-------------|----------|--------------|----------|
    | Cu01        | Or10     | Pro123       | 10       |
    | Cu02        | Or11     | Pro153       | 12       |
    | Cu01        | Or10     | Pro124       | 16       |
    | Cu02        | Or12     | Pro123       | 11       |
    - A primary key represented by the `Customer ID` column. 
    - A composite primary key represented by `Customer ID` and `Product Code` columns.
    ```
    Answer: A composite primary key represented by Customer ID and Product Code columns.
    Explanation: Thereâ€™s no single column that can be used as a primary key. So, the best approach is to use multiple columns as a composite primary key.
    ```

3. You need to create a table for staff members in a college. You must define the email address column as the primary key. Can the following SQL syntax be used to complete this task?
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Staff( Email VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL, Name varchar(255) NOT NULL, CONSTRAINT PK_Email PRIMARY KEY (Email));
    ```
    - Yes
    - No
    ```
    Answer: Yes
    Explanation: The constraint has been used in a proper way to define the email address as a primary key.
    ```

4. The following SQL code defines three primary keys: `SalesID`, `CustomerID` and `ProductID`.
    ```sql
    CONSTRAINT SalesID PRIMARY KEY (customerID, proudctID)
    ```
    - True
    - False
    ```
    Answer: False
    Explanation: In this example there is only ONE PRIMARY KEY (SalesID). However, the VALUE of the primary key is made up of TWO COLUMNS (customerID +productID).
    ```

    -   ```sql
        CREATE TABLE Orders ( OrderID int NOT NULL, CustomerID int, PRIMARY KEY (OrderID), FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(OrderID));
        ```
    -   ```sql
        CREATE TABLE Orders ( OrderID int NOT NULL, CustomerID int, PRIMARY KEY (OrderID), FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID));
        ```
    ```
    Answer: CREATE TABLE Orders ( OrderID int NOT NULL, CustomerID int, PRIMARY KEY (OrderID), FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID));
    Explanation: In this example the SQL statement creates a FOREIGN KEY on the "customerID" column when the "Orders" table is created.
    ```
