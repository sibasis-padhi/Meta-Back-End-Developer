# Knowledge Check: Database normalization

1. Which of the following is a key aim of database normalization? Select all that apply.
    - Simplify data queries
    - Minimize data duplication
    - Avoid errors during data modifications
    ```
    Answer: Simplify data queries
            Minimize data duplication
            Avoid errors during data modifications
    Explanation: The data normalization process aims to simplify data queries from the database.
                 The data normalization process aims to eliminate unnecessary data duplications.
                 The data normalization process aims to maintain data consistency by avoiding errors in data modification.
    ```

2. True or false. The first normal form allows for the storage of multiple values in table fields.
    - True
    - False
    ```
    Answer: False
    Explanation: The first normal form allows for the storage of atomic values of a column (also known as a single instance of data).
    ```

3. Partial Dependency occurs when a non-primary key attribute is functionally dependent on part of a composite key. This action violates which of the three normal forms?
    - Second normal form 
    - Third normal form
    - First normal form
    ```
    Answer: Second normal form
    Explanation: Partial dependency violates the second normal form.
    ```

4. True or false. Transitive dependency occurs when a non-key attribute determines the values of one or more other attributes, violating the third normal form criteria.
    - True
    - False
    ```
    Answer: True
    Explanation: Transitive dependency occurs when a non-key attribute determines the values of one or more other attributes.
    ```

5. What actions should you take to ensure that a database is in first normal form? Select all that apply.
    - Connect your table with other tables in the database using a foreign key.
    - Eliminate repeating groups of data within individual tables.
    ```
    Answer: Eliminate repeating groups of data within individual tables.
            Create a separate table for each set of related data.
    Explanation: Eliminating repeating groups of data is essential to meet the first normal form.
                 It is important to have a separate table for related data, so you can maintain data consistency.
