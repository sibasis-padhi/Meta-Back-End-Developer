# Knowledge Check: Operators

The chinook database deployed on the Coursera platform contains a table called `"invoices"`. The table itself contains a column called "Total" that shows the total amount to be paid by each customer. The `"Total"` data column and its values is as follows:
```
+-------+
| Total |
+-------+
|  1.98 |
|  3.96 |
|  5.94 |
|  8.91 |
| 13.86 |
|  0.99 |
|  1.98 |
|  1.98 |
|  3.96 |
|  5.94 |
|  8.91 |
| 13.86 |
|  0.99 |
|  1.98 |
|  1.98 |
|  3.96 |
|  5.94 |
|  8.91 |
| 13.86 |
|  0.99 |
|  1.98 |
|  1.98 |
|  3.96 |
|  5.94 |
|  8.91 |
+-------+
```

```sql
select total % 0.75 from invoices;
```
